## What I learned
### Hello world
- psvm and sout abbreviations are useful
- when having path stored in env variable, you can run it from powershell like $Env:var\app.exe, which can be useful for running stuff from different java or running stuff apart from IDE
### Imports
- Import Foo.* does not include stuff from packages which are in Foo
- Import static imports only static attributes/methods
### Readme.md syntax
- https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
### Data types
- primitives are value data types, Object stores a reference (boolean contains value, Boolean contains reference)
- local variables are not initialized
- primitive cannot be null
### Scopes
- NestedFishHorde.java you can run static block before constructor is executed
###Var
- Available since Java 10
- VarFish.java
