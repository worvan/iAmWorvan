## What I learned
### Hello world
- psvm and sout abbreviations are useful
- when having path stored in env variable, you can run it from powershell like $Env:var\app.exe, which can be useful for running stuff from different java or running stuff apart from IDE
### Imports
- Import Foo.* does not include stuff from packages which are in Foo
- Import static imports only static attributes/methods

### Readme.md syntax
